## Operator
 operators are special symbol that represent computations like additions, multiplications and so on. The values are called operands.

## Types of Operators
 1. Arithmetic Operator [✔]
 2. Assignment Operator [✔]
 3. Comparision Operator or Relational Operator [✔]
 3. Logical Operator 
 4. Membership Operator
 5. Identity Operator
 6. Bitwise Operator

### Arithmetic Operator (+,-,*,/,//,**)
 example: 5         +            5
       operand   operator     operand
 In Python:
        sum = 5 + 5
### Assignment Operator ( = )
 This operator is used to assign value(s) to a variable.
    
    Syntax:
     variable_name = variable_value
    
    Example:
     myvariable = 10
     mylist  = [1,2,3,4]
### Comparison Operator (<,>,<=,>=,==,!=)
    These operator are used to compare two operand(values) and return a boolean value.
    If operands results in a truthly value then return True otherwise False.

    Syntax:
        variable_name = operand  operator operand 
    
    Example:
        answer      =   10       >        20

        answer2     =   10       <        20

### Logical Operator (and, or, not)
 These Operator are used to combine conditional operator to evaluate conditions.
 - and -> returns True when all expression results True or Truthly otherwise Flase.
 - or -> returns True when atleast one expression results True or Truthly otherwise Flase.
 - not -> return inverse of the result.

### Membership Operator (in, not in)
    These operator are used to check if a sequence is or is not present in another sequence.

    - in -> return True when sequence is present in another sequence, otherwise False.
    - not in -> return True when sequence is not present in another sequence, otherwise False.
